# Banner Fetching Error Fix

## Problem

The error "Error fetching banners: [object Object]" was occurring because:

1. **Missing Route Registration**: Banner routes were imported but never registered in `server/index.ts`
2. **Database Timing Issue**: Banner endpoints were being called before database was fully initialized
3. **Empty Database**: No banners existed in the database

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Missing Banner Routes

**File**: `server/index.ts`

- Added all banner route registrations:
  - `GET /api/banners` - Public endpoint for active banners
  - `GET /api/admin/banners` - Admin endpoint for all banners
  - `POST /api/admin/banners` - Create banner
  - `PUT /api/admin/banners/:id` - Update banner
  - `DELETE /api/admin/banners/:id` - Delete banner
  - `POST /api/admin/banners/upload` - Upload banner image
  - `POST /api/banners/init` - Initialize default banners

### 2. Fixed Database Timing Issue

**File**: `server/routes/banners.ts`

- Added database initialization check in `getActiveBanners`
- Returns empty array gracefully if database not ready instead of throwing error

### 3. Enhanced Banner Initialization

**File**: `server/routes/banners.ts`

- Added `force=true` query parameter to clear and reinitialize banners
- Better error messages and status reporting

### 4. Improved Error Handling

**File**: `client/components/HeroImageSlider.tsx`

- Enhanced error logging with more detailed information
- Hide non-critical errors from users (empty banners is not an error to display)

## Results

- ✅ Banner API endpoints now work correctly
- ✅ Default banners are created and served properly
- ✅ Hero slider now loads banners without errors
- ✅ "Error fetching banners: [object Object]" is fixed

## Test Commands

```bash
# Test banner fetching
curl -s "http://localhost:5173/api/banners?active=true"

# Force reinitialize banners
curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:5173/api/banners/init?force=true"
```

## Default Banners Created

1. "Welcome to Aashish Property" - links to /properties
2. "Find Your Dream Home" - links to /buy
3. "Premium Properties in Rohtak" - links to /premium

All banners use high-quality Unsplash images and are set to active by default.
